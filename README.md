# Quest "Spring & JDBC: Select"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest introduces the use of databases into a web project by using Spring JDBC. It is especially focused on data selection here.

We are given a SQL file to import containing a database: characters and school from Harry Potter's book. 
 
The purpose here is to create routes to display a list of all schools, or to display a specific school by its id or its country, using **JDBC**.
